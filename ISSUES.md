## Planned Improvements

### KIT-72: Optimize GitHub Actions Schedule

**Title:** Determine Optimal Cron Job Frequency for Package Tracking

**Description:**
Currently, the GitHub Actions workflow runs every 6 hours to update package tracking information. We need to analyze the optimal frequency that balances:
- Timely delivery updates
- UPS API rate limits
- GitHub Actions usage minutes
- Package movement patterns

**Tasks:**
- Research UPS package scan frequency patterns
- Analyze when most status updates typically occur
- Test different cron schedules (every 3, 6, 12 hours)
- Analyze battery drain impact for mobile users refreshing the sheet
- Implement variable frequency based on package status (more frequent for "Out for Delivery")

**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Completion:** 3 days

### KIT-73: Dynamic Sheet Management

**Title:** Support Multiple Google Sheets with Dynamic Configuration

**Description:**
Enhance the system to support multiple tracking sheets for different purposes, customers, or batches. This will allow users to create new sheets on demand without modifying the codebase.

**Tasks:**
- Create a "master" configuration sheet that lists all tracking sheets
- Modify the script to read configuration from the master sheet
- Implement sheet creation functionality
- Add ability to set custom columns per sheet
- Create documentation for the new multi-sheet architecture

**Priority:** High
**Estimated Completion:** 5 days

### KIT-74: Shopify Integration

**Title:** Auto-populate Tracking Numbers from Shopify

**Description:**
Develop an integration with the Shopify API to automatically populate tracking numbers in the Google Sheet whenever a new shipment is created, eliminating manual entry.

**Tasks:**
- Research Shopify API endpoints for order fulfillment
- Create a Shopify App or private integration
- Set up webhooks for shipment creation events
- Implement script to extract tracking numbers from Shopify events
- Add new tracking numbers to the Google Sheet
- Add order/customer reference to connect tracking with orders
- Test with various shipping scenarios (multiple items, split shipments)

**Priority:** High
**Estimated Completion:** 7 days

### KIT-75: Multi-Carrier Support

**Title:** Add Support for Additional Carriers (USPS, DHL, FedEx)

**Description:**
Expand the tracking system to support multiple carriers beyond UPS, allowing comprehensive tracking across all shipping methods.

**Tasks:**
- Research API requirements for USPS, DHL, and FedEx
- Create developer accounts for each carrier
- Implement carrier detection based on tracking number format
- Create modular API interfaces for each carrier
- Standardize the response format across carriers
- Update the Google Sheet structure to include carrier information
- Add carrier logos or identifiers in the sheet
- Create comprehensive testing suite with sample tracking numbers

**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Completion:** 10 days

### KIT-76: Enhanced Notifications

**Title:** Implement Status Change Notifications

**Description:**
Create a notification system that alerts users when package status changes, especially for critical events like "Out for Delivery" or "Delivered".

**Tasks:**
- Implement status change detection logic
- Create email notification template
- Add support for Slack notifications
- Implement SMS notifications (optional)
- Create a notification preferences system
- Allow customization of which status changes trigger alerts
- Implement notification throttling to prevent spam

**Priority:** Low
**Estimated Completion:** 4 days

### KIT-77: Improved Error Handling

**Title:** Enhance Error Handling and Reporting

**Description:**
Improve the system's resilience to API failures, transient errors, and unexpected data formats by implementing more robust error handling and reporting mechanisms.

**Tasks:**
- Implement comprehensive error classification
- Create a dedicated error logging sheet
- Add automatic retry mechanism for transient errors
- Set up email alerts for persistent failures
- Implement progressive backoff for API rate limit issues
- Create an error dashboard for administrators
- Add self-healing capabilities where possible

**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Completion:** 3 days

### KIT-78: Performance Optimization

**Title:** Optimize Script Performance for Large Volume Tracking

**Description:**
Enhance the script's performance to handle hundreds or thousands of tracking numbers efficiently without hitting API limits or timing out.

**Tasks:**
- Implement parallel processing for tracking requests
- Add caching layer to reduce redundant API calls
- Optimize Google Sheets API usage with batch operations
- Implement rate limiting and throttling for API calls
- Create performance benchmarking tools
- Analyze and optimize memory usage
